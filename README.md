Tmmc innovation challenge 2024 uwaterloo
Challenge Description
Problem: 
The main focus of the TMMC Engineering project team is to find a reliable solution for using Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) to pick up and deliver vehicle components to defined stations in the manufacturing environment.

Requirements: 
An AVG is required to: 
Deliver an item from pickup point to delivery point, while:
Avoiding collisions with static fixtures (i.e. walls), and other AGVs
Obeying traffic signals (i.e. stop signs)

The ideal AGV will minimize the time of delivery.
