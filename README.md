Tmmc innovation challenge 2024 uwaterloo
Challenge Description
Problem: 
The main focus of the TMMC Engineering project team is to find a reliable solution for using Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) to pick up and deliver vehicle components to defined stations in the manufacturing environment.

Requirements: 
An AVG is required to: 
Deliver an item from pickup point to delivery point, while:
Avoiding collisions with static fixtures (i.e. walls), and other AGVs
Obeying traffic signals (i.e. stop signs)

The ideal AGV will minimize the time of delivery.

Challenge:
Level 1: keyboard control with safety features
Collision detection with wall – robot should stop and back up

Level 2: keyboard control with awareness
Stop sign detection – describe your strategy and then demonstrate

Level 3: autonomous control and static obstacles
No keyboard operation
Collision and stop sign detection
Record fastest delivery time

Level 4: autonomous control and dynamic obstacles
Moving robot (NPC)
Describe your strategy and then demonstrate
Record fastest delivery time

Level 5: multi-agent/fleet control
2 AGVs + moving robot (NPC)
